  <h3>Who are Artificial Intelligence Engineers?</h3>
  <!-- Paragraph Tag -->
  <!-- &nbsp (nobreakspace is used to give space between words) -->


  <p>AI engineers &nbsp are tasked with building models
    to deploy AI-based applications,for example,
    in order to satisfy a requirement, a business might need to incorporate.
    AI systems that can predict anomalies. It is the job of AI engineers to use ML techniques
    and neural networks in order to achieve this. The research and evaluation that is required before
    designing the system are also carried out by AI engineers. Unlike traditional
    ML engineers who use datasets to carry out current objectives, AI engineers must ensure that,
    AI systems keep functioning with external input. ML engineers are focused on current objectives ,
    while AI engineers ensure that the system can sustain itself and function without supervision.</p>
  <!-- Break Tag (to Break line) -->
  <br>
  <p>AI engineers are experts in AI reasoning, logic, probability analysis and uncertainty.
    These engineers use ML concepts for building solutions and then monitor how the system (solution)
    functions. This allows them to identify the flaws in the system and keep improving it. AI engineers
    also have to take care of data processing and data mining that is involved with training the AI system.
    They must also design the entire data system and infrastructure that will sustain the AI project.
    Thus, AI engineers must be fluent in both data science and programming. Speech recognition is another example of
    an application of AI that is built using NLP, machine learning concepts, analytics and massive datasets.
    Unlike traditional developers, AI engineers must be fluent enough to work with all of these together.

  <h3>Skills Required to Become an Artificial Intelligence Engineer</h3>
  <h5>Here are the skills that are necessary for artificial intelligence engineer jobs &nbsp:</h5>

  <ol type = "I" start = "1">
    <li>Mathematics: AI models are based on algorithms, calculus and linear algebra. Thus, being fluent in mathematics is a must. </li>
    <li>Statistics: AI-based systems are heavily dependent on probability models, statistical analysis and other models that rely on statistics. For example, Naive Bayes or Gaussian Mixture models. </li>
    <li>Programming: In order to design AI systems, learning programming languages such as Python, C++ or even Java is a must. One can also learn Scala or R. AI engineers need to write programs and test systems.</li>
    <li> Analytics: AI engineers must have analytical skills in order to interpret valuable data. In order to properly build a functional AI model, one needs to be able to analyse data, gain insights and then identify solutions. One needs to be able to work with large datasets as well.</li>
    <li> Communication: This is important in order to understand business requirements from stakeholders. Business communication comes in handy when reporting about progress or new developments.</li>
   
  </ol> 






        <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence engineers help convert intelligence solutions into practical applications.
           Even though machine learning is an important part of AI, artificial intelligence engineers are not
           just ML engineers but also AI architects.AI engineering requires systematic research and creativity,
           thus, one can expect to do a lot of brainstorming as an AI professional.
